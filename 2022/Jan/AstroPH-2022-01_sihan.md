1.[The Gas-Star Formation Cycle in Nearby Star-forming Galaxies II. Resolved Distributions of CO and Hα Emission for 49 PHANGS Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01403)
> Extragalactic Galaxy, gas, star-formation

This work compared observations of CO line emission and narrowband H$\alpha$ maps of 49  nearby star-forming main sequence disk galaxies.
Results at 150 pc resolution suggest that the relationship between molecular gas and SFR tracers in the Kennicutt–Schmidt plane depends on host-galaxy properties.
Galaxies without these structures, galaxies with a stellar bar only, and galaxies with both a bar and granddesign spiral arms exhibit broadly similar sightline fractions.

>Galaxy structure, filaments

By using a customized minimum spanning tree algorithm to identify filaments by linking Galactic clumps from the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy catalogue, They identify 163 large-scale filaments with physical properties derived, including dense gas mass fraction, and compare them with an updated spiral arm model in position-position-velocity space.
Dense gas:  take contour with a higher level in the extinction map as the boundary to calculate dense gas, and contour with lower level as boundary of total mass.
Dense gas mass fractions of filaments have no significant distinctions in different Galactic radii and vertical height above Galactic mid-plane, in contrast to previous studies.
Bone fraction and DGMF do not vary too much in different spiral arms.
Dense clumps in filaments have no obvious distinction in mass compared with those not in on the same scale.

They present high-resolution maps of the dust reddening in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), which have a spatial angular resolution between 26 arcsec and 55 arcmin, based on the data from the optical and near-infrared (IR) photometric surveys, including the Gaia Survey, the SkyMapper Southern
Survey (SMSS), the Survey of the Magellanic Stellar History (SMASH), the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the near-infrared Y JKS VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds system (VMC).

>fundamental parameters, star formation

ALMA-MaNGA QUEnching and STar formation (ALMaQUEST) survey.
The extinction-corrected H𝛼 flux is then used to determine the star formation rate.
The Partial Correlation Coefficient analysis shows that ΣSFR depends directly on just ΣH2 and has no intrinsic dependence on Σ∗.

They have studied the CO-to-H2 conversion factor and the line ratio of CO(2–1) to CO(1–0) in high-resolution (∼0.2 pc) hydrodynamical simulations of a multiphase ISM across a wide range of metallicity (0.1 ≤ Z ≤ 3) in HSvD21.

This data adds evidence that there is a clear correlation between the cluster truncation mass Mc and ΣSFR.

They found deep learning to be a reliable approach to produce 3D extinction maps from large surveys.
With this methodology, They expect to easily combine heterogeneous surveys without cross-matching, and therefore to exploit several surveys in a
complementary fashion.

These results suggest that galactic dynamics plays a major role in the efficiency of the gas conversion into stars.
Their work adds supporting evidence that density-threshold star formation models, which argue that the SFEdense should be roughly constant,
fail to account for spatially resolved SF relations of dense gas in the SB ring of NGC 1068.

They present 0.3'' (114 pc) resolution maps of [C I] (1–0) and 12CO (1–0) obtained toward Arp 220 with the ALMA data.
The overall distribution of the [C I] (1–0) emission is consistent with the CO (1–0). While the [C I] (1–0) and CO (1–0) luminosities of the system follow the empirical linear relation for the unresolved ULIRG sample, they find a sublinear relation between [C I] (1–0) and CO (1–0) using the spatially-resolved data.
