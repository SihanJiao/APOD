> Extragalactic Galaxy, gas, star-formation

This work compared observations of CO line emission and narrowband H$\alpha$ maps of 49  nearby star-forming main sequence disk galaxies.
Results at 150 pc resolution suggest that the relationship between molecular gas and SFR tracers in the Kennicutt–Schmidt plane depends on host-galaxy properties.
Galaxies without these structures, galaxies with a stellar bar only, and galaxies with both a bar and granddesign spiral arms exhibit broadly similar sightline fractions.

>Galaxy structure, filaments

By using a customized minimum spanning tree algorithm to identify filaments by linking Galactic clumps from the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy catalogue, They identify 163 large-scale filaments with physical properties derived, including dense gas mass fraction, and compare them with an updated spiral arm model in position-position-velocity space.
Dense gas:  take contour with a higher level in the extinction map as the boundary to calculate dense gas, and contour with lower level as boundary of total mass.
Dense gas mass fractions of filaments have no significant distinctions in different Galactic radii and vertical height above Galactic mid-plane, in contrast to previous studies.
Bone fraction and DGMF do not vary too much in different spiral arms.
Dense clumps in filaments have no obvious distinction in mass compared with those not in on the same scale.
