In a legacy project called FIlaments Extremely Long and Dark: a MAgnetic Polarization Survey (FIELDMAPS), we are using the High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera Plus (HAWC+) polarimeter (Dowell et al. 2010; Harper et al. 2018) on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) to map 214 µm polarized dust emission across ∼10 of the 18 known bones.

Based on the age of the H II region we conclude that this expanding H II region is responsible for the triggering of the current star formation activity in the region.

 We confirm that the physical parameter that best correlates with the oxygen abundance is the stellar mass.
